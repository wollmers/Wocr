# SYNOPSIS

    $ wocr setup
    $ wocr daemon

# DESCRIPTION

[Wocr](https://metacpan.org/pod/Wocr) is a Perl web application.

# INSTALLATION

[Wocr](https://metacpan.org/pod/Wocr) uses well-tested and widely-used CPAN modules, so installation should be as simple as

    $ cpanm Wocr

when using [App::cpanminus](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus). Of course you can use your favorite CPAN client or install manually by cloning the ["SOURCE REPOSITORY"](#source-repository).

# SETUP

## Environment

Although most of [Wocr](https://metacpan.org/pod/Wocr) is controlled by a configuration file, a few properties must be set before that file can be read. These properties are controlled by the following environment variables.

- `Wocr_HOME`

    This is the directory where [Wocr](https://metacpan.org/pod/Wocr) expects additional files. These include the configuration file and log files. The default value is the current working directory (`cwd`).

- `Wocr_CONFIG`

    This is the full path to a configuration file. The default is a file named `Wocr.conf` in the `Wocr_HOME` path, however this file need not actually exist, defaults may be used instead. This file need not be written by hand, it may be generated by the `Wocr config` command.

## The `wocr` command line application

[Wocr](https://metacpan.org/pod/Wocr) installs a command line application, `wocr`. It inherits from the [mojo](https://metacpan.org/pod/mojo) command, but it provides extra functions specifically for use with Wocr.

### config

    $ wocr config [options]

This command writes a configuration file in your `Wocr_HOME` path. It uses the preset defaults for all values, except that it prompts for a secret. This can be any string, however stronger is better. You do not need to memorize it or remember it. This secret protects the cookies employed by Wocr from being tampered with on the client side.

[Wocr](https://metacpan.org/pod/Wocr) does not need to be configured, however it is recommended to do so to set your application's secret.

The `--force` option may be passed to overwrite any configuration file in the current working directory. The default is to die if such a configuration file is found.

### setup

    $ Wocr setup

This step is required. Run `Wocr setup` to setup a database. It will use the default DBI settings (SQLite) or whatever is setup in the `Wocr_CONFIG` configuration file.

# RUNNING THE APPLICATION

    $ Wocr daemon

After the database is has been setup, you can run `Wocr daemon` to start the server.

You may also use [morbo](https://metacpan.org/pod/morbo) (Mojolicious' development server) or [hypnotoad](https://metacpan.org/pod/hypnotoad) (Mojolicious' production server). You may even use any other server that Mojolicious supports, however for full functionality it must support websockets. When doing so you will need to know the full path to the `Wocr` application. A useful recipe might be

    $ hypnotoad `which Wocr`

where you may replace `hypnotoad` with your server of choice.

## Logging

Logging in [Wocr](https://metacpan.org/pod/Wocr) is the same as in [Mojolicious](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Lite#Logging). Messages will be printed to `STDERR` unless a directory named `log` exists in the `Wocr_HOME` path, in which case messages will be logged to a file in that directory.
